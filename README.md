#Hi, I'm Monica 👋🏾 👩🏾‍💻
I'm Rishikesh, an enthusiastic student pursuing my final year bachelor's degree in computer science and engineering at Aryabhatta Knowledge University. 
Being a quick learner and hard worker by nature, I do not shy away from taking on new, challenging roles and responsibilities.

I ameliorate my skills with numerous certified courses in Coursera and HackerRank.
I have completed multiple internships to gain hands-on experience in this field as a Trainee and completed my summer research intern at IBM and my Summer training at IIT Kanpur.

I enjoy doing coding and I practice regularly to keep up my pace and accuracy. 
As my interest lies in the field, I'm looking for full-time work in the stream of software development, data science, and system engineering. 
I'm an optimistic person and an excellent team player. 
I'm open to learning new things that are out of my comfort zone.
To know more about me and my work ethics you can contact to my mail id.
